Low latency & Fastest FPS, High Accuracy, Most power efficient and simplest hardware design. MagikEye produces DK-ILT001 evaluation kit on 2021/Q3. This evaluation kit is designed for users who would like to try Invertible Light(r) technology quickly. https://www.magik-eye.com/,",

Specifically, Miyazawa provides an overview and demonstration of Invertible Light 3D sensing technology. By showcasing 200 FPS on a simple CMOS sensor and a small 3mm*3mm cube projector, Invertible Light enables the smallest, fastest and most power-efficient 3D sensing method.",
        "Takeo Miyazawa, Founder and CEO of Magik Eye, presents the 'Game Changing Depth Sensing Technique Enables Simpler, More Flexible 3D Solutions' tutorial at the May 2019 Embedded Vision Summit. <br> Magik Eye is a global team of computer vision veterans that have developed a new method to determine depth from light directly without the need to measure time, find a complex pattern or perform complex computation. The Magik Eye technique dramatically reduces the power, compute and size of a depth-sensing module while enabling a wide range of FOV, point resolutions, material sensitivities and distances. This presentation discusses the new technique and shows working samples in action.",
        "Takeo Miyazawa, CEO and Founder of Magik Eye, demonstrates the company's latest embedded vision technologies and products at the 2019 Embedded Vision Summit. Specifically, Miyazawa demonstrates the great advantage of Invertible Light for surveillance and smart security. A single 3D sensor by Magik Eye is shown to provide full 180-degree hemispheric field of view (FOV) depth sensing, as compared to multiple sensors that would otherwise be needed today. Miyazawa also shows how reflective surfaces and materials, which are extremely difficult for other 3D sensing methods, can also be seen with Invertible Light."
